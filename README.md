## Champion composition analysis

Collecting data from EUW server, loading all summoners found in ranks Silver IV to Diamond I.

Will analyse team comps for win rates, frequency and some other basic metrics.

Hope to categorise champion types, and then will be able to group team compositions using
these champion clusters. The set of all possible team comps is massive, and the chance of a team comp recurring is 
 very low, and so it is not only difficult to get a good set of statistics for that team comp, but also those 
 statistics would be be of great use as there is a low likelihood of that team composition occurring again. 
 
 By clustering champion types, the overall number of team comps by champion group will be much lower, and so we 
 will be able to get better set of statistics, and hopefully understanding of building a good team.
